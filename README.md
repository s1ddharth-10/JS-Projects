## Installation

To run the BMI Calculator locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bmi-calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd bmi-calculator
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.**

## Usage

1. Enter your weight in kilograms (kg).
2. Enter your height in meters (m).
3. Click the "Calculate BMI" button.
4. Your BMI will be displayed along with your weight category.

## How It Works

The BMI is calculated using the formula:

```
BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
```

The application uses JavaScript to handle user input, perform calculations, and display results dynamically.

### Example Calculation

If a user inputs:
- Weight: 70 kg
- Height: 1.75 m

The calculation would be:
```
BMI = 70 / (1.75 * 1.75) = 22.86
```
This result falls within the "Normal weight" category.
